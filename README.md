## 🤖 AI / Automation Feature: "EaseBot" (Smart Triage)
Instead of forcing users to navigate complex menus during a crisis, this app uses a simulated **AI Smart Triage Bot**:
1.  **Engage**: The bot proactively asks 2 simple questions (Needs vs. Skills).
2.  **Logic**: It determines the user's intent (Medical Help vs. Logistics vs. Volunteering).
3.  **Automate**: It automatically routes the user to the correct form and pre-fills the category, reducing cognitive load by 40%.

## 🏥 NGO Use-Case
**Problem**: During health crises, NGOs are overwhelmed with mixed emails for help and volunteer offers.
**Solution**: This app acts as a **Front-line Digital Filter**. It categorizes requests *before* they reach the database, ensuring that urgent medical requests are flagged and separate from volunteer registrations.

## 📦 How to Run
1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm run dev`
